# :balance_scale: Kilograms ReactJS + NodeJS Express on Heroku

An automated Shopping List

**Product Description**
A hypothetical device to measure the weight of any box. Assuming, a miniature digital scale that can stick on any pantry box. The Kilograms app will give you the updated status of your pantry, whenever you take out or put in the item in the box, the digital scale will update the weight on the server and you will know the status through the app.

I came up with this idea after struggling to find any such device in the market, and I planned to make the Web App first, this app is under development.

**Web App Technical Description**
API is made in expressJS and mongoose(MongoDB database). On Heroku, the database is connected through mLab, where the shopping list database is hosted in MongoDB. Front End is using React.
